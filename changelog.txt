Domibus 4.2
- added new properties:
    smp.http.forwarded.headers.enabled to control usage of Forwarded parameters RP/LoadBalancer.
    smp.ui.session.secure: Cookie is only sent to the server when a request is made with the https: scheme (except on localhost), and therefore is more resistant to man-in-the-middle attacks.
    smp.ui.session.max-age: Number of seconds until the cookie expires. A zero or negative number will expire the cookie immediately. Empty value will not set parameter
    smp.ui.session.strict: Controls whether a cookie is sent with cross-origin requests, providing some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks. Possible values are: Strict, None, Lax. (Cookies with SameSite=None require a secure context/HTTPS)!!)
    smp.ui.session.path: A path that must exist in the requested URL, or the browser won't send the Cookie header.  Null/Empty value sets the authentication requests context by default.  The forward slash (/) character is interpreted as a directory separator, and subdirectories will be matched as well: for Path=/docs, /docs, /docs/Web/, and /docs/Web/HTTP will all match.
