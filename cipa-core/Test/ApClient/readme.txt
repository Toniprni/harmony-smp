This is the start access point command line test client. It allows to send a document to a start access point. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to set up the client please update the following files located in the conf folder of the access point client:
- configSAML.properties: Configuration of the saml token. Edit the file to provide the sender id (id included in 
  the token), the service Name (included in the token also) the paths to the keystore containing the sender ap certificate
  and the password of the private key and the keystore.
- configServer.properties: this file contains the information needed by the client to sign the message before sending it and
  to verify the signature of the response. Edit the file to provide the paths to the keystore containing the sender ap certificate
  and the password of the private key and the keystore. Update also the server.truststore.path property to point to the installation 
  folder of the client.

The client uses the java endorsed mechanism to avoid class loading conflicts between the javax.xml.ws classes from the JRE and the metro
ones (webservice stack used by the AP). the command to run the client should specify the following property -Djava.endorsed.dirs="$AP_CLIENT_FOLDER$\endorsed"
the $AP_CLIENT_FOLDER$ being the path to the ap client installation folder. the client.bat file provided in this package can be used to call the client after you 
adapt it to your local set up.
